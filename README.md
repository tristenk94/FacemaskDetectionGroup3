Background Information
	In the beginning of 2020, COVID-19 took the nation by storm, forcing many businesses to close their doors or to enforce a face mask policy on their premises. With having these two as options companies were forced to have their customers and staff wear masks to decrease the risk of the disease spreading further. With the end of this quarantine still to be undetermined companies must find a way to monitor the individuals in their store in order to avoid losing customers or shutting down.

Design Principle
In order to be able to train the model we would need images of people wearing masks at different distances, angles, positions relative to the camera. Our main source of images was through kaggle. We were able to find 853 images(all with at least one face) and a majority of them with multiple faces. Along with these images were annotation.xml files that would give information not only about the size of the image but information about the faces in the image. Using these annotation files we would be able to train the model and determine whether the predictions given by the model were correct or incorrect, further details about the annotations will be provided below.
